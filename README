Scripts for Arista EOS ZTP. These scripts are meant to be delivered to an
Arista switch via ZTP through DHCP. 

BaseConfig.py - From the Arista ACE Class lab, this script initializes the 
      		switches in the lab by determining the Ethernet interface
		connected on Management1. In the lab, the student switches
		are configured based on their position in the network. 
		ex: the switch connected to Ethernet 5 is Student-05.
